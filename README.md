Testing game using Web APIs

## Description
This website provides a useful introductory quiz about JavaScript, but it is also a culmination of several JavaScript skills. The user can start the quiz by pressing the "Start Quiz" button; the timer in the top right provides the scoring function, and the goal is to answer all five questions as fast as possible!  However, there are deductions for false answers, so if you want the top score, make sure to answer correctly.  Once the quiz is over, the user has the opportunity to log their initials to store their score on the Highscores page.  

This was a very interesting dive into arrays, objects, for loops and localStorage, and I feel very strong positive and negative emotions about this Challenge. It was certainly frustrating to complete, but the sense of satisfaction is almost equal to that.


## Current Bugs
*The styling is tremendously basic. I plan to upgrade the CSS when I have a little more time, and when I need more CSS practice!

## Installation
The website is accessible at the links below. You can navigate there with any functional web browser.

## Usage
Navigate to the webpage. Click "Start Quiz," then off you go! The list of highscores can be viewed at any time by clicking the "View Highscores" link in the top left corner.

I used the following websites to help progress through this coding Challenge. They guided me through how to sort my array of objects, how to get items from an array of objects, and so much more. I hope they might help you if you're interested in making your own quiz game website .
